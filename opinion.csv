"I am not going to go into much detail about these, because I'm sure if you're looking into buying these, you've probably read up on them. I will say this. For one, I really like the adaptive sound. It is a bit slow, but when I'm wearing them it has helped alert me someone had come up to me. The fit is very comfortable, but I have noticed my ears get itchy if I wear them for too long. I don't know what's up with that. I never experienced that with the regular airpods. All in all, these are very nice, and I'm glad I have them."
"I spent $200 for Airpod Pro, and $200 for a 9th gen Ipad, and I have hearing aids! My $5000 pairs are broken, and this is a pretty good replacement for now. It took a bit of figuring out how to get the Ipad to do what was needed, but once that part was done, I can wear the earbuds full time as hearing aids. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5: the drawbacks I read about are accurate. The battery life is about 6 hours, so I have to charge them in the middle of the day. And, the volume range could be much better. I know the volume capability of the earbuds, and the hearing amplification doesn't use more than a small fraction. And, the voice amplification is pretty good, but they also amplify background noises like clicking of silverware on plates way more than they should. If these items are improved, 5 stars for sure. If you are considering this, here's some tips I wish I knew. First, absolutely use Mimi for the hearing test. Then, activate your hearing profile in Apple Health and enable it for the earbuds. To get them in hearing aid mode, I go the bluetooth settings, sync the earbuds to the ipad. An airpod pro item appears in settings. I select that and the controls are there. That's all there is to it. I can turn off the ipad and go about my day. When I recharge the earbuds and put them back in, they are still in hearing aid mode so I almost never even need the ipad. Update: to get the last bit of volume out of hearing aid mode, be sure to turn OFF conversation boost. It turns the airpods into directional mikes, and boosts whatever is directly in front of you by decreasing the volume of everything else. Turning it off gave me a noticeable increase in volume. Be sure to try it."
"The Apple AirPods Pro 2 deliver excellent audio quality with deep bass, crisp mids, and a very immersive spatial audio experience. The active noise cancellation is impressive — it blocks out most ambient sounds during commutes or while working. I also really appreciate the new USB-C charging and the hearing aid-style amplification feature, which adds a nice layer of accessibility. That said, the fit could be more secure for longer wear, especially during workouts, and the battery life still leaves a bit to be desired. But overall, these are top-notch wireless earbuds that integrate seamlessly with the Apple ecosystem. Would definitely recommend for anyone in the Apple world looking for premium sound and advanced features."
"Hearing test did not work, and it took some 8-9 sessions/emails with Apple (and over 2 months) to resolve -- it did work once I went to the Apple health app included on the iPhone. Frustrating. Wearing as an aid to hearing most noticeably increases the sound of one's own voice more than helps with speech from other sources. Probably will not use unless listening to something on my phone, i.e. as regular earbuds."
"The battery on this is great, so is the sound and noise cancellation. It’s great that it comes with smaller ear buds. Only complaint I have is be careful when dropping because it scratches and chips easily. I was walking back from the gym and one of them fell out of my ear on the concrete and now it looks somewhat beat up. Wish the outside was a bit more durable."
"I have always avoided buying Apples ear buds in the past because I think they are overpriced. Unfortunately, this pair does nothing to change my perception. They don’t fit my ears well even with the smallest ear tips they tend to pop out. I purchased ear clips to hold them in place but have not yet put them on the buds. The other issues revolve around the software that comes with them. First it tracks me where ever I go. I don’t want my earbuds to track me. It is okay for me to track them. But one of my Amazon tablets and my desktop computer told me that ear buds were tracking me. Additionally, the buds sans buttons are not my thing. I like buttons because I know what I am doing. I don’t accidentally make a call, fast forward, turn the volume down or off. Or any of the other things the buds do. As for the sound it good but I can’t say outstanding. The noise cancellation is feature is the best I have ever experienced. One bud came loose from my ear and I was startled by the noise from my surroundings. While Apple tells you the batteries only last 6 hours that is far too short. I am also not pleased with white being the only color option. They for me are not an item I could use for workouts because they don’t stay in my ears."
"If what you are looking for is an inexpensive option for hearing aids these may work for you but they have drawbacks. First they dont' always stay in the ear. I am not sure why I use other ear bud style for listending to music and that stay in though those always have a around the ear hook. Amazon sells after market hooks but the ones I tried didn't help. I am not sure why. Since they don't stay sealed in my ear it causes noises whistles etc my wife hears across the room. For me these wouldn't work as general purpose hearing aids though I could sit on the coach an put them in and not worry if they fall out and hear the TV better, just watch out when I go in the bathroom don't want they falling off and into something. Sound quality is sometimes good sometimes less good depending on the seal. They are not for me. I returned them and now have a much more expensive pair of Sony hearing aids that are working very well. But is you want low cost the Apple Airpod Pro 2 may be ok for you."
"I really love the nose canceling ability of these headphones as well as the ability to play with the sound (i.e. conversation awareness, transparency, spatial audio, etc), HOWEVER, i would be remiss to not note that these things HURT in my ears. granted, i’m a small woman (5’5”, 115lbs) with smaller ears, but even with the size XS ear rubber attachments on my airpods they still hurt me badly as it’s not a problem with the rubber attachment, it’s a problem with the shape of the plastic. i cannot comfortably wear both headphones for longer than 30 minutes so i often have to switch them out every half hour or so to stay comfortable. i don’t know how no one else has mentioned this before because everyone i have spoken to in my personal life has echoed the same sentiment. i wish there was a way to still have the noise canceling and audio features without the pain of the plastic shape of the airpod."
"Good for music and program audio but NOT GOOD HEARING AIDS. Here is why. They don't react quickly enough to loud harsh sounds. You get blasted. And sound from them as hearing aids seems to me to be from the end of a tunnel. Disclaimer about what I'm about to say now.. I have no interest in Bose or the Lexie company. Now that I've said that the Bose Lexi Hearing Aid's are the best hearing aid I've ever used and I've used them all. They're so comfortable that I wish that I could keep them on while I was sleeping or lying in bed watching the TV. It's easier to forget that you have them on again. I have no interest common stock or anything in either of these companies I'm just trying to be helpful. These are not good hearing aids. AND, the bose lexie hearing aids are lousy for music. unfortunately, you cannot wear both"
"If you want to use his hearing aids, you better have an entire day of discovery reviews going to YouTube try every trick you can to make them work. I reviewed numerous hearing aids over the counter and numerous over-the-counter earbuds. I never had the trouble that I had with this product. in order to use them as hearing aids, you first have to do a hearing test. But you can’t do a hearing test unless you pass a foot test, meaning the AirPods have to fit properly in your ears. Well, good luck on that. Change the tips change the position, change the tips again change the position and still Knogo. And then you discover there’s no workaround you cannot do the hearing test until you pass the fit test. I went to the health app on the iPhone and it’s the same exact test. Fortunately, I had access to an old application for a hearing test, Mimi. I was able to do a hearing test there. But can I upload it? Yes, but it didn’t mean anything it went to the Health folder, but it didn’t go to the AirPods. I finally printed it out and then scanned it and was able to put it into the program For the AirPods. Did that work? Not really. You have to have a hearing test that’s not too mild or too strong when you have to have a moderate test results. If you get results, they don’t show a strong need for hearing aids or shows and higher than moderate need for hearing aids, the AirPods refused to turn into the hearing function. I had to take several hearing test and tell me them around to get one that was satisfactory For the AirPods.... OK it’s sort of works now. But you pay a price. Music and everything is not filtered through the hearing function and can be quite mudded and difficult to change the tone despite the controls so you can change the tone. What is up to you. I gave it three stars mostly because , Apple has so in adequately prepared you for Wes to come. If you’ve had a ton of experience with earbuds and iPhones, and dealing with applications, be my guest. If you don’t settle for something simpler."
"I really love these AirPods BUT this is my second purchase and I have had same exact issue with both. Yes, there is a fixing according to Apple support and, obviously, you have to pay for. These new pair, I just got it Nov/2024 and it is already going for repair. Starts with a little bit of statics and grow to a major “water running” kind of statics with great frequency. I still love them if compared to others I had in the past. But honestly I’m not happy, maybe is all about luck? I will try once again, but third time is last for me."
"I have used these long enough to write an honest review. Yes the sound quality when both pods are in is great and these have excellent noise cancellation when they are both in. I cannot deny that. But what I will say is the battery life on these are no where near as good as my 2nd gen AirPods. Also the comfort level. I cannot lay down with these because they hurt my ears. I also do not feel they fit as nicely as my 2nd gen AirPods. They are okay but for the money they should be great, and I feel these fall way short of great for the price point."
"Don't buy Apple from Amazon," I was told by Apple. The returns are handled differently and the window is considerably shorter. These ear buds have a mind of their own. They twang at times, disconnect, charge differently (or not at all), and discharge differently, and are unreliable for calling. And they pair with every other Apple device anytime, until you disconnect them. I was invited to send them in for repair. . . . after I had them for only 10 days as the return window had closed. What a waste. They do sound great tho!"
"I’m on my third pair of these AirPod Pro two. I haven’t found a pair yet out of three that will work with my LG TV. I have been been getting a loud crack and static randomly with them. I don’t know what the problem is, but three pairs of AirPods plus Apple support got no significant results. I have returned these AirPods. It started on May 6, and they are still in transit to go back. UPS had to pick them up. The direction said somebody 18 years old to be there for the pick up. I took this as the driver would come to my door. I was wrong. He did not come to the door at all on the porch two times didn’t see them and didn’t pick them up. I finally put them on the porch and they were picked up That was on May 6. It’s now the 22nd and it doesn’t look like I’m gonna get my refund before June. Meanwhile, the money for these pods it’s not available to me. So, my recommendation is one do not buy them from Amazon due to the long turnaround time. My second recommendation is if you get the rack and static on one pair it’s very likely you will get them on the next pair. And yes, I did try to contact Amazon, UPS And Apple. Nothing from any of them. No help!"
"I recently picked up a pair of Apple AirPods Pro 2, and while I'm a long-time Apple user, I was genuinely disappointed with this pricey piece of tech. Priced as a premium audio product, these wireless earbuds lack the wow factor that their cost suggests, leading me to give them a mere two stars. For starters, the price point is nothing short of jaw-dropping. Retailing for around $249, I expected a revolutionary audio experience, but what I got was an overly simple pair of earbuds with features that don't truly stand out from competitors—many of which are significantly cheaper. The sound quality is decent but no better than my old wired earbuds, and the supposed “pro” audio signature feels more like marketing fluff than a meaningful enhancement. The noise cancellation is good, but again, there are many brands offering similar or even superior performance for a fraction of the cost. If you’re looking for pure sound isolation, brands like Sony and Bose deliver superior products without the hefty Apple tax. On the usability front, while the integration with Apple devices is seamless, the battery life is underwhelming. I find myself needing to recharge them more often than I anticipated, and let’s not talk about the occasional connection hiccups that remind you that premium price doesn’t always equate to premium performance.... In conclusion, the Apple AirPods Pro 2 feel more like a status symbol than a genuinely groundbreaking product. If you’re a die-hard Apple fan and value brand loyalty above all else, they might be worth a look. However, for those seeking outstanding audio performance without breaking the bank, there are far smarter, budget-friendly options out there. Ultimately, it’s hard to recommend a product that feels both overpriced and underwhelming in execution. Save your money and explore other alternatives!"
"If you have the first or second generation Airpods keep them and DO NOT upgrade to these. These things disconnect at will, for no reason at all. I am convinced it’s because of all of the unnecessary additions Apple added to them. Switching between songs is a hassle. On earlier generations all you had to do was tap to change songs or answer a call, now you have to squeeze, and as god is my witness, if you don’t have the right setting turned off these things will disconnect from your device..on top of disconnecting at will. This is incredibly frustrating and the folks at Apple keep assuring me these garbage AirPods are working correctly. The distance you can travel from your phone before these AirPods are out of area” is less than half of distance of the other generation AirPods. And Yes, I measured. Please, take it from me, save your money or buy an off brand. Off brands offer better functionality, connectivity, and are three times less than these ridiculously high priced headphones. Call them what you want, Apple. . . “Apple AirPods” doesn’t mean “worth the price….Just like your phones."
"Hello Apple, with all the hype online and your history of top quality products I'm really disappointed at the quality of the AirPods Pro 2. Is it really a hearing aid? I went to Pleasanton CA Apple Store and the Apple Store in Valley Fair in Santa Clara for help to set up my new pro2 to use the hearing aid feature, none of them were able to help (we were not taught to program the device!). They are supposed to be your Experts! Here is what happens to my Pro 2: in the low frequency region of my hearing the sound was mumbling, It is worse than my AirPods #2. In the high frequency region the AirPods #2 is not loud enough, to be expected because it is not supposed to be able to selectively amplify the voice but the AirPods Pro 2 was full of noise, apparently it has been amplifying indiscriminatorily. Come on, Apple, you can do better than that. We need WiFi sound here. The way it is is not Apple Product, it is more like ... Please do something! Release new software or fix your hardware so that it is more like a hearing aids! Even if you have to make it larger in physical size. The way it is, it is poor! It is not worse the money! It is not doing the job it claims to, no good. You lose your reputation big time! what is happening to you guys?"
"Received dupe AirPods, I honestly think I was given good condition used ones by accident because the box was taped on the back instead of sealed with the plastic Saran Wrap like regular AirPods. I really ordered brand new ones so I’m kinda upset. crazy thing is they looked exactly like the real ones. I didn’t notice they weren’t the authentic ones until I paired them with my phone and tried to use them on a phone call. It’s sounds like a walkie talkie is on the other end. What threw me for a real loop was that It came in an Apple box and everything (just without a charger). Don’t get me wrong, everything about the headphones were perfect but I want the Apple brand AirPods if I’m gonna be paying $200. Oh and your music stops whenever you receive notifications and Siri doesn’t read it to you with these. But like I said … still good I guess. There’s just no way these were Apple AirPods I received."
"These could be amazing AirPods. I want to love them - but I don’t. I just spent over an hour on the phone with Amazon trying to figure out why 1)they won’t connect to a standard LG TV and then 2) trying to figure out how to change the volume via touch of the stem of the AirPod which I confirmed with the Amazon technical support staff. The touch works with your iPhone. Will not work with your TV. So - my old AirPods are much better in terms of functionality. My real reason for buying these more functional AirPods was for the hearing aide feature. The hearing aide feature is great. So my experience is that I have a fairly inexpensive set of hearing aides that I like but less capability in terms of pure AirPod than my much cheaper versions. Amazon has a ways to go to get these to be 5 star."
"I bought these to try as hearing aids, because I'm unable to clearly hear what my SO says nowadays, so to secure them to my head temporarily, I used memory foam tips from Sonicfoam (B0BHMQ6D8G). Unfortunately, no matter what settings I chose on the iPad I had to buy to be able to control the hearing aid functionality of the AirPods, I couldn't understand my SO any better, so the AirPods didn't work as a hearing aid for me. While they were still attached, I also tested them as a phone call headset, but I found that, for calls in a noisy room, the much cheaper Dytole Bluetooth Headset (B0DJ6THPKC) I have is far superior. To the people I'm talking to, my voice sounds drastically clearer, with far less background noise, when I use the Dytole (B0DJ6THPKC). One thing that the AirPods excel at is being noise-canceling earplugs. My AirPods arrived charged and were set to sound-blocking mode by default, so when I put them in, after 1 second, they seemed to suck all the sound out of the room. Ultimately, I think, a lot of people buy these headphones for safety reasons. They will never get stuck on your head, or inside your ears, because physically they were designed without a head-coupling mechanism."
